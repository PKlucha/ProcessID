# ProcessID
## Simple and horribly written PID displaying program.

Lots of redundancy, but it works. 3 more hours and it might look pretty good.

## Building and executing commands:

1.  mkdir build
2.  cmake -S . -B build
3.  cd build
4.  make
5.  ./ProcessID


### Build on Raspbian 10 (Buster), GNU/Linux.
